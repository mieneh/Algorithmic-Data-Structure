# 1 Based on the code in Lab 1, you need to implement theStackADT which containsgeneral data type<E>. Then, implementFractionclass and test your program

# 2 Based on the code in Lab 1, you need to implement the Queue ADT which contains general data type <E>. Then, implement Fraction class and test your program

# 3 Compute the result of the following expression by using recursive approach and eliminate recursive by using Stack.

```
p(n) = 2^n + n^2 + P(n-1),n>1 || p(n) = 3, n = 1
```

# 4 Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters and prints them in reverse order, using Stack.

# 5 Write a program that reads in a sequence of characters, and determines whether its parentheses, braces, and curly braces are ”balanced”.

**Hint**: for left delimiters, push onto Stack; for right delimiters, pop from Stack and check whether popped element matches right delimiter.

# 6 Show how to implement a Queue using two Stack.

# 7 A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is spelled the same forward and backward.

For example, 'dad' is a palindrome; 'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama' is a palindrome if you take out the spaces and ignore the punctuation.

Implement a program to determine whether an input is palindrome using one `<Character>` Stack and one `<Character>` Queue.
